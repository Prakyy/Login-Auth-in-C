# Digital Assignment -1
## Write a C program that uses stack and heap memories, along with the appropriate memory allocation and deallocation (memory management). You should also draw general memory layout with the snapshot of your programâ€™s variables on stack and heap memories at a particular time.

This is just for my 2nd Semester DA1.

Currently, it can only take single word inputs because I'm using scanf(). I could use fgets() but I'm not sure how to implement it properly as I have 
tried adding it before but it's just skipping the first input, for some reason. I might figure it out later but I'm very swamped with work and this
will have to do for now.
